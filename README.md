# Flux

Flux is a small text editor based on [antirez's kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo), with some adjustments (which will be continued going forward).

The editor was written as a practice in systems and application development by following along with [Paige Ruten's tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) in order to understand how each function is implemented in connection with the greater whole.

In the command line, run `make` to compile and `./flux` to run the program.
